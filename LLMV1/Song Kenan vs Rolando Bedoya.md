### Analysis and Prediction

Song Kenan has the experience advantage and has faced tougher competition in his career. His knockout power and striking accuracy will be key factors in this fight. Rolando Bedoya, on the other hand, is relatively inexperienced but has shown promise in his striking game, albeit in a very limited sample size.

The odds reflect Kenan's experience and overall skill advantage, but Bedoya's reach advantage and striking accuracy may present some challenges.

Prediction: While anything can happen in MMA, based on the information available, I'd favor Song Kenan to win this fight. His experience and striking ability should allow him to control the fight and potentially find a finish. However, Bedoya's striking should not be underestimated, and he may present a tougher challenge than the odds suggest.
