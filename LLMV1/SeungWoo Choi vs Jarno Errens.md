SeungWoo Choi's experience and relatively better striking and takedown stats make him the favorite in this matchup. The model's predictions for Choi also support this, though it's worth noting that the models for Errens are not available.

Choi's reach and height advantage, coupled with his ability to land more significant strikes per minute, will likely play a crucial role in this fight. If he can keep the fight standing and utilize his striking, he should have the upper hand.

On the other hand, Errens might look to close the distance and attempt takedowns, although his debut showed no success in this aspect. He will need to significantly improve his game to overcome the odds in this matchup.

Based on the available data, I would predict a victory for **SeungWoo Choi**. The model's predictions seem to align with this, as indicated by the scores in the Profit, Odds, and Plain models for Choi. However, it's essential to consider that MMA fights can be unpredictable, and Errens' potential improvements since his debut could lead to a surprise performance.
